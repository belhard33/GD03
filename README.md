# GD03--Red Team
Team members:  Brittney Elhard, Shipra Jain, Sowjanya Kunti, Tasmiya Salim Mujawar, Tianyi Wang

Objective:  Our team took continuous data from Twitter and narrowed down our search to Sports.  
Shipra led the charge in finding out how we should each connect to Twitter's API to be able to access the real-time data.  She also helped us find adidtional daily data to supplement our collected data (as our daily collections over 2 weeks was not close to 10 MB).  The team as distinguished below took on the following coding sections. 

From our data file collected over several days, we wanted to:

(Shipra)
